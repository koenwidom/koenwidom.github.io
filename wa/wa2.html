            <p>I am a CTD student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I enjoy reading, writing, drawing, music, and spending time in nature. This website was created as a project for my Web class. My goals for this course are to learn how to make a cool functional website. I think that's the point&mdash;I mean, the class is called Web, right?
